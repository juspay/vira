      🍾 Welcome to the **vira** project

      To run vira,

      ```sh
      just run
      # If you want to reset the database before running, run instead:
      just resetdb run
      ```

      Then open <https://localhost:5005>

      (Now, as you edit the Haskell sources, the above will reload!)

      🍎🍎 Run 'just' to see more commands. See <https://nixos.asia/en/vscode> for IDE setup.
