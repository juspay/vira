File tailing library with multi-subscriber support.

This library provides a Haskell API for @tail -f@ style file streaming
using 'STM', 'Control.Concurrent.Async', and system processes.

Example usage:

@
import System.Tail

main :: IO ()
main = do
  tail <- 'tailFile' 100 \"\/var\/log\/app.log\"
  subscriber <- 'tailSubscribe' tail
  -- Read from subscriber...
  'tailStop' tail
@
-}
module System.Tail (
  -- * Core Types
  Tail,

  -- * Operations
  tailFile,
  tailStop,
  tailSubscribe,
) where

import Control.Concurrent (threadDelay)
import Control.Concurrent.Async (Async, async)
import Control.Concurrent.STM.CircularBuffer (CircularBuffer)
import Control.Concurrent.STM.CircularBuffer qualified as CB
import System.Directory (doesFileExist)
import System.IO (hGetLine)
import System.Process (CreateProcess (..), ProcessHandle, StdStream (..), createProcess, proc, terminateProcess, waitForProcess)

-- | Represent `tail -f`'ing a file in Haskell
data Tail = Tail
  { filePath :: FilePath
  -- ^ The file being tailed
  , stop :: TMVar ()
  -- ^ Signal to stop tailing
  , tailProcess :: TVar (Maybe (ProcessHandle, Async ()))
  -- ^ The tail process handle and async reader
  , queues :: TVar [CircularBuffer Text]
  -- ^ Active subscriber queues
  , ringBuffer :: CircularBuffer Text
  -- ^ Ring buffer storing last N lines for new subscribers
  }
