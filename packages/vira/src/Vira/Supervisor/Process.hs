{- | Run a sequence of processes sequentially in the given working directory.

Processes run one after another, stopping on the first non-zero exit code.
If outputFile is Just path, process output is logged to that file.
If outputFile is Nothing, process output goes to stdout/stderr.
Returns 'Left Terminated' if interrupted, or 'Right ExitCode' on completion.
