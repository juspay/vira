Entity-scoped broadcast mechanism for SSE (Server-Sent Events).

This module provides a type-safe way to broadcast entity-scoped update events
to connected clients. Events are scoped to specific entities (e.g., "repo:my-repo",
"job:123") so that only pages listening to that entity will reload.

= Usage Pattern

Producer side (broadcasting updates):

@
broadcastUpdate (RepoScope "my-repo")
broadcastUpdate (JobScope 123)
@

Consumer side (listening for updates):

@
-- 1. Subscribe: create a duplicate channel for this listener
chanDup <- subscribeToBroadcasts

-- 2. Consume: read pending events from the duplicate
scopes <- consumeBroadcasts chanDup
@

The subscription model uses 'dupTChan' to allow multiple independent listeners.
Each listener gets their own duplicate channel starting from "now" (old messages drained).

{- | Broadcast an entity-scoped update event to SSE listeners

Use this to notify clients when specific entities change:
- JobScope for job updates
- RepoScope for repository updates

This triggers page reloads only for pages listening to that specific entity.

  BroadcastScope ->
  Eff es ()
broadcastUpdate scope = do
  chan <- asks @ViraRuntimeState updateBroadcast
  liftIO $ atomically $ writeTChan chan scope
  log Info $ "ðŸ“¡ " <> show scope

{- | Subscribe to broadcast updates by creating a duplicate channel

Creates an independent read-only view of the broadcast channel for a new listener.
Old messages are drained so the listener only receives updates from "now" onwards.

This should be called once per listener (e.g., once per SSE connection).
-}
subscribeToBroadcasts ::

  ) =>

    dup <- dupTChan chan
    void $ drainRemainingTChan dup
    pure dup

{- | Consume all pending broadcast events from a duplicate channel

Drains all events currently in the channel and returns them as a list.
This is non-blocking - returns immediately with whatever events are available.

Each event is logged at Debug level.
