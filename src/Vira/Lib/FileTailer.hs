{- | Efficient pure Haskell file tailing implementation

This module provides a memory and CPU efficient alternative to external `tail -f`
processes, using fsnotify for file change detection and STM for coordination.

= Mechanism

The file tailer works by:

1. **fsnotify-based detection**: Uses filesystem events to detect file modifications,
   eliminating polling overhead and providing near-instant responsiveness
2. **Incremental reading**: Tracks byte offset and reads only new content since
   last read, minimizing memory usage even for large files
3. **STM coordination**: Uses TMVar for stop signaling and TVar for tracking
   multiple client subscription queues
4. **Broadcast distribution**: New lines are distributed to all subscribed
   client queues simultaneously
5. **Graceful shutdown**: Stop signals ensure clean termination and final
   message delivery to clients

= Features

* **Memory efficient**: Only reads new content (KBs vs MBs for large files)
* **CPU efficient**: No polling - only processes actual file changes
* **Responsive**: Near-instant detection of new log lines via filesystem events
* **File rotation handling**: Detects when files are truncated or replaced
* **UTF-8 safe**: Handles encoding errors gracefully

= Limitations

* **Line-based only**: Assumes UTF-8 text files with line breaks; binary files
   or files without newlines are not supported
* **fsnotify dependency**: Requires filesystem event support (works on Linux,
   macOS, Windows)
* **Single file**: Does not handle log rotation to different filenames
